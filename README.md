# The Tipify

The Tipify is a flexible and dynamic tool for creating tooltips with various customizations. It offers dynamic positioning, local storage for data persistence, and the ability to map data for multiple tooltip elements.
Features

# 1. Dynamic Positioning

The component intelligently positions tooltips based on the available space around the target element. It provides four positioning options: below, above, left, and right, ensuring that the tooltip is always visible and never obstructs the content.
# 2. Local Storage Integration

Your tooltip data can be saved and retrieved from the browser's local storage. This allows you to persist your tooltip configurations even after refreshing or closing the web page.
# 3. Data Mapping

The component seamlessly integrates with a set of tooltip data. Each tooltip can have unique configurations, such as content, font size, padding, text color, background color, corner radius, tooltip width, arrow width, and arrow height. Additionally, tooltips can contain images for richer content.
# 4. Image Upload

You can upload images for individual tooltips. The uploaded images are displayed within the tooltips, adding visual elements to your custom tooltips.
Usage

The component allows extensive customization through CSS. You can style tooltips, tooltip arrows, and other elements as needed to match your project's design.
Compatibility

This component is built using React and is compatible with modern web browsers.
